\section{Urban legends about self driving cars}
It is quite difficult or impossible to find reliable sources for the following story, this is why it can be stamped as an urban legend. The tale is always told a bit different, varying in the acting person's gender, age or the reason they wanted to leaf the driver's seat. Nevertheless, the essence in all versions is the driver steering a new bought van or caravan, having an additional cruise control extra, to hold the speed while driving. For a certain reason the driver wants to pick something up, from the back of the vehicle, so he or she remembers, that there is this new feature installed in their car. The mistake was mixing up cruise control with a fully adequate autopilot, so as they turn on the "auto pilot" and leave their front seat, while driving, of course the vehicle leaves the road and crashes. \newline
This story, was presumably first recorded on paper, by Jan Harold Brunvand in 1984 \cite{brunvand}, however it is still present today and can be found in all varieties on the Internet. While the person's idea of cruise control might have been considered extremely dumb or unworldly, when the story first appeared, this expectation became successively imaginable as the years went by.

\subsection{DARPA Grand Challenges}
In 2004 the first DARPA Grand Challenge took place \cite{darpa2004} in the Mojave desert(USA), proclaimed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was a competition between different teams, competing to build an autonomous driving vehicle, that should be able to drive a predefined course, with a length of 240 kilometers, without any control advices from outside. In total 15 cars competed, due to technical problems none of the teams was capable of completing the full course, in fact the furthest distance driven was around 11.9 kilometers, fortunately this was not the end of these competitions. \newline
The next year's Grand Challenge was held in 2005, this time 23 cars participated in the race, 22 of them were actually capable of passing the record created in proceeded year. In fact five vehicles were able to finish the race completely.
