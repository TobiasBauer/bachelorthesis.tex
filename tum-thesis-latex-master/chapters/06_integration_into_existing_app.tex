\chapter{Integration into existing Android App}\label{chapter:Integration into existing App}

The Existing app, already had some features related to the open source car driving simulator Speed Dreams, before going deeper into these functionalities, the present structure and appearance is highlighted.
First of all, a dark theme has been chosen for the design of the app. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:main_screen}, the main screen contains different tiles for each task. It is possible to choose the source of intended input, therefore the user decides between loading an existing image (Figure \ref{fig:load_image}), or hitting the camera icon to start a live-video feed of the back-facing camera. Depending on the input source chosen, the wanted functionalities are either applied one single time on a loaded image or multiple times per second on the live input, either way, the outputs are printed onto the original images. Both features, named "Vehicle Detection" and "Lane Detection" are pretty much self-explaining, but it should be mentioned that both methods were being trained by Speed Dreams' data, meaning that the lane detection is good for detecting lanes in the game, but might not be that brilliant in detecting real lanes, furthermore the vehicle detection recognizes only the back of a red car in the virtual rally course.\newline
To select the new functionalities, a new tile was added (Figure: \ref{fig:new}), having the same possibilities to choose from, as the already existing ones. As a representative image, a picture with a speed sign was chosen and edited to look like how the actual detected image should in the future.
