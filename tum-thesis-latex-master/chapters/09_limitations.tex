\chapter{Limitations}\label{chapter:limitations}
As previously stated, the mayor shortage of this work is the not finished workload of implementing the stated mechanics into the app. \newline
Consecutively the connectivity with Speed Dreams, the driving simulator, is completely neglected, until the current day, because this task only made sense to realize when the app operated as wanted.\newline
Another disrupting issue with the presented algorithm becomes visible, when running the app's speed detection on camera: The detected ROI alternates randomly from the inner white area of a sign to the full red outer circle and vice versa. This poses no problem to the classifier, as it was trained to recognize both views, but when the app is on camera mode, it appears a little bit sloppy, but as the priority of this problem was relatively low, compared to, for example the first, it was postponed to the end, if there would have been any time left.\newline  
Additionally, it would have been nice if the test and training datasets were a bit larger to improve the robustness and to actually get a more accurate testing result. Furthermore, not every possible speed sign is being covered, because this work should only be a proof of concept.  
Nevertheless every mentioned issue could be fixed.
