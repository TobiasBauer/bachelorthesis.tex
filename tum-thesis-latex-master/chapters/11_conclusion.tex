\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}
Although the final goal of having a functioning app, interacting with the driving simulator, was not fulfilled thoroughly, it was shown, that the overall concept, in fact, does work. Advanced driver assistant systems like the presented, are essential parts of fully autonomous vehicles. Just like moore's law describes, an exponential growth in, casual speaking, processing power of devices can be observed. A similar phenomenon can be seen in terms of autonomous driving, coming back to the example from the beginning, when in 2004 the best self driving car was only able to drive a few miles off-road, whereas nowadays testing on public roads is being done and series production is in close proximity. It is particularly interesting to watch where all this is heading, because transportation is a subject, that somehow strikes every person living in our society. The transportation sector is currently changing and redefining itself as never before, it is steering into a more complex, but also more secure future. A change, where everybody profits, whenever the overall safety is increased.
