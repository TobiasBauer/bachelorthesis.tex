\chapter{\abstractname}
In this thesis the major steps of creating a concept and implementation to recognize and classify speed signs will be presented, in order to extend an already existing application with new functionalities. The app's purpose is to assist a driving simulator, running on a different system. Components of this application are image processing techniques, as well as artificial neural networks. Furthermore, different approaches for computer vision and machine learning are going to be depicted and discussed, also the progression from advanced driver assistant systems through to fully autonomous driving vehicles are going to be illustrated.
